# How to Use the Models

Under `Models/model-testing-project/Characters`, each model's `.dae` file and texture directory are put into a directory. Copy them to Godot project directory.

After copy models into Godot project, double click the `.dae` file, choose `inheritence` option, a Godot `.tscn` scene will be generated. Then we can use and modify it as we want.

We need to modify the `material` file to make the texture looks more natural.
